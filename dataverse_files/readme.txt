Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records

Notes: The programs and data sets available here will produce the results in tables 1 through 4, as well as figure 3. The code for tables 1, 3, and 4 also contain a correction that affects standard errors. Correcting this error reduces the standard errors somewhat relative to those published. Uncommenting the correction as indicated in the programs reproduces the published results. There is also a very minor discrepancy in Table 3, probably due to the use of a different CPI than was used for the published paper. The figures in the original paper were not typeset in the proper order. Click here <http://www.jstor.org/view/00028282/di971049/97p0127o/0> to view the corrected version.
